# ferm define for generic production database access.
# Two ports are opened here:
# The main, production use port, which by default is 3306, but
# could be any other, usually in the 3310-3330 range.
# The extra port, which resides on 3307 by default, and on
# production port + 20 on the others (e.g. 3317 has its extra port on 3337).
# Production port access is, for now, limited to the internal network.
# Extra port is limited to mysql production root hosts (cumin, tendril).
# More specialised classes could grant additional access to other hosts or
# subnetworks.
